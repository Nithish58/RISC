# Refactoring List
(We write tests for reinforce, startup and fortify phase before refactoring)

1. ### remove duplicated showCommands   
    At build 1, showCommands such as showPlayer(), showAllPlayer(), showMap() exist in every controller including mapLoaderAdapter, gameController, startUpGameController, reinforceGameController and fortifyGameController.

    At build 2, we extract all showCommand methods and make them a static method in the MapDisplayUtils.class to avoid duplication.

2. ### move player state and corresponding logics (set and get current player, add and remove player, switch players) from the gameController to model named PlayerService.class.

3. ### remove game controller, unnecessary boolean values and unnecessary dependency of other controllers on gameController. This improves the readability and extensibility of the code. 
    
    At build 1, game controller has references of other controllers. It also has a lot of boolean values to determine which controller to call based on these boolean values.

    At build 2, we remove game controller, its dependency on other controllers. We remove some of boolean values, instead we  use gamestate to determine which controller to call from the view that receives user's input.

4. ### remove logic relating to reinforce(), exchangeCards() from reinforceController to model Player.class. The reinforceController is used to check the validity of the command

5. ### remove logic relating fortify() from fortifyController to model Player.class. The fortifyGameController is used to check the validity of the command

6.  ### add GameView and Controller as the interface
    At build 1, we have only CommandPromptView to receive users commands, and sent it to different controllers according to the game state.

    At build 2, we have three different views, phaseView, dominationView and exchangeCardView. We make these three views implement GameViewInterface. This would make the system more flexible as we could replace these views in the future. The same case for the controllers, we would be able to replace these controllers easily in the future based on changing requirements.

 7. ### refactor mapLoaderTests including extracting logics and parameters in different methods to make tests more readable and understandable.
